Open the hello-comp423 directory in VSCode.</p> <p>B. Go to the extensions tab of VSCode, this tab looks like a square with one piece leaving.</p> <p>C. Search for and install the Dev Containers VSCode extension.</p> <p>D. Now create a .devcontainer directory in the root of your project.</p> <p>E. Inside this .devcontainer directory you will need to create a new file with the file name: <pre><code>devcontainer.json\n</code></pre> F. Open this file and insert the following snippet of code:  Insert into .devcontainer.json<pre><code>{\n    \"name\": \"Rust Development Environment\",\n    \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/rust:latest\",\n    \"customizations\": {\n        \"vscode\": {\n            \"extensions\": [\n                \"rust-lang.rust-analyzer\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Let's discuss this configuration</p> <ul> <li>name: Gives a descriptive name to your current development container.</li> <li>image: This configures our development container to pull the latest Rust base image from Microsoft for Docker to use to create our environment. Essentially, this allows us to run the Rust language while in the container without having to install any software onto our local machine! The Rust software instead will exist inside our container thanks to pulling the base Rust image. </li> <li>customizations: Adds useful configurations to VSCode, in this scenario it will download the rust-analyzer extension. Adding the extensions into the automatic configuration file for our development container ensures that other engineers working on your project will not be missing any necessary extensions. </li> <li>extensions: Installs any needed extensions automatically. In this case, thte official <code>rust-analyzer</code> VSCode plugin by the Rust Programming Language Group.</li> </ul> <p>G. Now, open the command pallette. macOS shortcut: <code>command + shift + p</code>. Windows shortcut: <code>ctrl + shift + p</code>.</p> <p>H. In the command pallette enter <code>&gt;Dev Containers: Reopen in Container</code>. </p> <p>I. This will build your development container! This may take some time to load. You will know you are connected to you container when you see a blue rectangle in the bottom corner of your screen that says \"Dev Container: Rust Development Environment\".</p> <p>J. Before we continue, you should check your version of Rust by running the following command in the VSCode terminal:  <pre><code>rustc --version\n</code></pre>     You should see version 1.83.0 or greater if a later version has been released since the writing of this tutorial.</p> <p>Congrats! You have now successfully set up your Rust development container!</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>When closing and reopening your project you will need to reopen your dev container. You can do this by opening the command pallette again and running <code>&gt;Dev Containers: Reopen in Container</code>. Remember to give the environemnt time to load.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#writing-your-first-rust-program","title":"Writing your First Rust Program!","text":"<p>Time to write your first Rust program! In good tradition we will be writing a \"Hello World\" inspired program. </p> <p>A. Make sure that you are inside your hello-comp423 directory in VSCode and that the dev container is running.</p> <p>B. Open a terminal inside VSCode and run the following command: <pre><code>cargo new hellocomp --vcs none\n</code></pre></p> <p>What does this command do?</p> <p>This command will create a new Rust project named \"hellocomp\"! The <code>--vcs none</code> flag will make sure that the cargo new command does not create a new git repository.</p> <p>C. Navigate to the src/main.rs file in your project directory. </p> <p>D. Edit the default \"Hello, World!\" statement to say \"Hello COMP423\" and save the file.</p> <p>E. Now return to the terminal in your VSCode window and run the following commands to compile your project: <pre><code>cd hellocomp\ncargo build\n</code></pre></p> <p>What do these commands do?</p> <p>The first command enters the hellocomp Rust project we created in the previous cargo command. We must enter this project directory for the terminal to have access to the necessary files to execute the program. The second command, <code>cargo build</code>, compiles our project similar to running gcc in C! When a program is compiled it is translated from the high-level language we know, Rust, to a machine-readable binary file that can be executed by the compiler. The <code>cargo build</code> command just compiles your program into an executable format, it does NOT execute the program! </p> <p>F. If you want to run the executable created by <code>cargo build</code> you will need to run the following commands. The executable file by default is given the same name as your project. </p> <pre><code>cd target\ncd debug\n./hellocomp\n</code></pre> <p>G. Alternatively, run the following command to compile AND execute your program: <pre><code>cargo run \n</code></pre> OR <pre><code>cargo run main.rs\n</code></pre></p> <p>What does this command do?</p> <p>This command causes the compiler to compile our project AND execute. This is different from <code>cargo build</code> as <code>cargo run</code> actually executes the binary file while the <code>cargo build</code> command just compiles the binary file. Using <code>cargo build</code> alone is good to use for debuggging your program, and using <code>cargo run</code> is good for when you are ready to execute your program!</p> <p>H. In the terminal after the <code>cargo run</code> command you should see \"Hello COMP423\" output! </p> <p>I. To commit and push these changes to your GitHub repository, run the following lines of code in your terminal: </p> <pre><code>git add . \ngit commit -m \"Hello COMP423\"\ngit push origin main\n</code></pre> <p>Congrats! You have successfully set up a development container from scratch and created your very first Rust project!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#additional-information-for-mastering-cargo","title":"Additional Information for Mastering Cargo","text":"<p>Some more examples of ways you might use the Cargo tool can be found below.
